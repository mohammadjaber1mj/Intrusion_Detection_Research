# Intrusion_Detection_Research

A machine learning-based intrusion detection systems with a focus on enhancing model robustness against data poisoning. The project examined various label manipulation strategies and their impact on classification reliability.
A Proposed a multi-layered defence framework combining digital signature verification, blockchain-based provenance, and anomaly detection analysis to safeguard training pipelines from tampered labels in security-critical environments.
